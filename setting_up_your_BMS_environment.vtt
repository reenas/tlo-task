Hey everyone. Now that you've finished setting up your workspace and

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
 installing python. Let's look at how it works with

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.100
 the project file. So first what you can do is-

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.100
"click the download project file in the

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.600
 content"

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.200
and it will be automatically downloaded 

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.700
in the computer 

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.800
system.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000
Open My Computer in your computer system.

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.100
Go to any drive that you have

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.600
 free. 

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.200
Just create 

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.300
a new folder.

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.800
In this new folder

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.100
just drag the zipped downloaded file 

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.900
and drop in the 

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.700
new folder.

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.200
In the new folder you have your zip file that you've downloaded.

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.700
Right click on this file and click extract here. You can

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.300
 either click extract 

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.300
here if you have WinRAR

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.800
Or you can click extract 

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.400
here in the 7Zip dropdown.

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
So you have extracted the data that is in

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
 the zip file. 

25
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.800
Open this.

26
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.900


27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.200
Click on "BMS_main.ino".

29
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
Now it's going to cause an error. Let's see what

30
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.600
 the error is.

31
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.100
File BMS_main.ino needs to

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 be inside a folder named BMS_main

33
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.500

34
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.100

35
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.300
The BMS_main.ino is not

36
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.500
 inside a folder named BMS_main.

37
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 It is inside a folder name BMS_main-main

38
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.800


39
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.400
So you need to 

40
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.400


41
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.000
rename this sketch folder as BMS_main

42
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700


43
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.400


44
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.000
Let's

45
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.400
close all the programs.

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.200
Okay.

47
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.400
Let's try again

48
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.200
after renaming

49
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.400
Now BMS underscore main

50
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.700
is the name of the folder. Open this folder and click on the

51
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.900
 Arduino file named BMS_main.ino.

52
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.900
Okay. So this is the file that is going to be uploaded on

53
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.800
 to the Arduino. 
54
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.800
To make

55
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.500
 it simpler to read we have split the code into

56
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.600
 multiple sections. So in the battery management system

57
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.200
 section first while that is

58
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.300
 this just outputs of all the data to the

59
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.500
 Python program. We'll understand how the Python program works later. But

60
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.600
 this is basically the output part but let's look

61
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 at the calculation part. There is the battery voltage part.

62
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.200
 There is the control part. There is the current

63
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.100
 sensor to extract all the current

64
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.600
 data the output current from the Arduino of the

65
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.800
 battery management system and the temperatures from the

66
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.300
 ambient temperature that is the room temperature

67
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.200
 and temperature for cell number one and cell number two.

68
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.100


69
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.200
All the calculations happen in the temperatures section.

70
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.400
And all the calculations for the battery voltages happen in the batteryVoltages section. This

71
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.500
 section has

72
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.200
all the functions that deal with

73
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.300
 controlling the charging discharging of the battery

74
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.200
 maintenance system.

75
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.600
So you can send and receive data through here.

76
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.400
So we'll understand how this works much better

77
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.500
 in the next level.

78
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.000
So this is basically just click.

79
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.200
First of all select

80
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.100
 your Arduino Nano select which

81
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.800
bootloader it needs to be installed on.

82
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.200
select the port

83
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.600
for the code.

84
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.400
And just select upload, once uploaded it will

85
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.900
 go on to the BMS.

86
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Then upload it first.

87
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.600
It might take some time to upload depending on your PC and now that it has completed

88
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.400
 uploading. Go to tools and then go to

89
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.900
 serial monitor.

90
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.600

91
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.600
You need to switch on your BMS.

92
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.600
You will start getting all the data .

93
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
There are the iterations and all

94
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.600
 the data in the BMS window. You don't have to be able to read this. 

95
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.400

96
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.700
This data will go into the Python

97
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.000
 program.

98
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.700
The name of Python program is called BMS

99
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.500
 _analytics.pi.

100
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.800

101
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.600
Your Arduino is currently COM6 right now. That

102
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.100
 is because of USB serial port. All the ports there are

103
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.300
 Bluetooths whatever other com ports or

104
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.200
 communication ports are available on your PC will be displayed here or not.

105
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.800
 But go with the port that says USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM6)

106
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.200


107
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.700


108
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.700


109
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.700


110
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.100
start the battery management system dialog box.

111
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.800


112
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.500
You get to the dashboard and we'll learn how the dashboard

113
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.100
 works later.

114
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.500
Thank you.
